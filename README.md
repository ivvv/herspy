# Python works for _Herschel_ Space Observatory data access and analysis

The repository `herspy` is where I keep most of my python analysis scripts and notebooks.

**Warning:** these works are in most cases preliminary and should be used with caution.

Feel free to get in contact, i.e. raise an issue in case of comments.
